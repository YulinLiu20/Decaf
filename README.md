**DeCaf** (Decentralized Canister Feed) is a data infrastructure project designed to unlock the rich, underutilized data on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. While ecosystems like Ethereum benefit from advanced analytics platforms (e.g. Dune, Glassnode), ICP remains largely inaccessible to researchers, developers, and AI agents.

DeCaf solves this by providing a real-time, structured, and decentralized data feed—powered by ICP canisters—tailored for three key user groups:

-**Academia**, enabling professors and students to research ICP like they do BTC and ETH.

-**AI Agents**, offering machine-readable feeds for model training and autonomous reasoning.

-**Industry**, supporting dashboards, DeFi strategies, and on-chain analytics.


By turning ICP into a first-class data citizen, DeCaf fuels the next wave of insights, innovation, and adoption across Web3.
